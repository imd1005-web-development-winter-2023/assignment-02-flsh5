      themselves in their videos rather than their real identities. 
      While he often covers songs, he also creates his own songs and 
      albums. He has a wide vocal range, and can reach high notes with 
      ease. Mafumafu started his music activities... Click to read more.</p>

    <p>Dejavu was originally published on youtube on November 23rd, 
    2019 with a music video to go along with it. It was later 
    released on spotify and other streaming services on January 10th, 
    2021. This song and music video are the last part of a trilogy of 
    songs and videos. The first two songs being, Merry Bad End, and 
    Hello Dystopia. This song follows the same girl seen in the music 
    videos of the previous two songs and how she begins to lose sense 
    of reality and who she truly is inside. â€¦ Click to learn more. <p>

    <p>On May 5th, 2021, Mafumafu rented one of 
      the biggest stadiums in Japan to perform a 
      virtual concert for free on Youtube!</p>

    <p>In March 2020, Mafumafu had sold out shows 
      to perform live at that stadium, however, because 
      of the rapid spread of Covid-19, he had to cancel 
      and refund all the tickets. A little over a year 
      later, he decided to hold a show there again, 
      only this time making it a worldwide distribution, 
      and completely free! His reasoning was so that 
      anyone from anywhere could join the stream and 
      could hopefully get some joy during the troublesome 
      times the world was going through. He has left the 
      full stream available on Youtube, so people can 
      always go back to it and enjoy it again.</p>
